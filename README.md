Sex trafficking is one of the most horrible crimes and is something we should all get together to try and solve. We are building an app that can, through crowdsourcing, help identify places that are targets of sex trafficking.

Interface-wise: -Each user should be able to mark a particular residence/house which they think could be a target of trafficking.

-Visualization: Users should get a heat map kind of view about the sex trafficking regions and their density. So if multiple people marked a particular place/area, that would help the police organize the priority they could investigate in.
